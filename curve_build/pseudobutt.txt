    - chord position in %
    - span position in %
    - pressure side or suction side (ps/ss)

create the cross sections at 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, and 1.0 span positions

apply ps/ss to isolate only upper/suction or lower/pressure curves
apply chord position to interpolate a bspline along the span
    - 
apply the span position to obtain the point along the interpolated bspline curve

return the point coordinates in a spreadsheet
