user input
    - chord position in %
    - span position in %
    - pressure side or suction side (ps/ss)

create the cross sections at 0.0, 0.25, 0.75, and 1.0 span positions

apply ps/ss to isolate only upper/suction or lower/pressure curves
apply chord position to interpolate a bspline along the span
    - 
apply the span position to obtain the point along the interpolated bspline curve

return the point coordinates in a spreadsheet

#######################################################################################################################
find the point on the first airfoil/span section/position (should be bezier) using chord position input
find the point on the last airfoil/span section/position (should be bezier) using the same chord position input

(the z positions should be the same for both points; first and last. This value should be used for the injection location z-position)

Assume zero blade twist or turning 
use the x & y positions of those two points to make a straight line between them. Find the slope of this line
find the desired x-position based on the span position input and the x-positions of the first and last points of the blade.
use the desired x-position and the slope of the line to obtain the desired y-position
